Figure 3.5S: Oxygen concentration was measured using an oxygen probe (see Methods - Oxylite) to verify that the oxygen concentration in the chamber was as expected. Measurements were taken at points where conditions may have been subject to change. For the combination treatment (Hyp + IR), cells were measured in the chamber before irradiation, post irradiation and at 24 hours. Similarly, the IR treatment was measured pre and post irradiation whilst the hypoxic treatment was measured at the end of the 24 hours. For normoxia, media was on average at 19% O2, whereas for cells that were placed in the 2% Buffa/RUSKINN chamber, an average of 1.5% O2 was detected. 

Confirmation of oxygen concentration was essential as due to the decrease in senescence in Figure 3.5, it opened up the question that perhaps the chamber may be a lot lower than anticipated (closer to 0%) hence the trend that was observed in the Hyp + IR treatment; however, conducting this simple test helped rule out that possibility.
