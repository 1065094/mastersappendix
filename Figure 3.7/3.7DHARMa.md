This graph displays whether a GLMM was an appropriate model for this dataset. There is deviation, which resulted in uncertainty surrounding the significance displayed from the GLMM.
Therefore, to be sure a Wilcoxon rank signed test was conducted alongside a Bonferroni correction to ensure significance is the same as calculated in the GLMM. P-values were adjusted as per multiple comparison testing.
