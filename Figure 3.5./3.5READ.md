This graph displays whether a GLMM was an appropriate model for this dataset. There is slight deviation, though this is acceptable to some extent. To be sure a Wilcoxon rank signed test was conducted alongside a Bonferroni correction to ensure significance is the same as calculated in the GLMM.
Besides these two tests, there was no other known appropriate method to display and calculate significance.
